# Fast RGB Box

This is a simple GUI project implemented in Python using the Tkinter library. It features a visual box that cycles through the primary RGB colors (red, green, and blue) at a fast interval. The user can control the cycling process with "Start RGB" and "Stop RGB" buttons.

## Features
- **Color Cycling Box**: The box cycles through red, green, and blue colors at a speed of 100 milliseconds (0.1 seconds).
- **Control Buttons**:
  - **Start RGB**: Starts the color-cycling process.
  - **Stop RGB**: Stops the color cycling, leaving the box at its current color.
- **Interactive GUI**: Clean and simple user interface built with Tkinter.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python by default)

## How to Run the Project
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Copy the code into a file named `fast_rgb_box.py` or any filename of your choice.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the file is saved, and run:
   ```bash
   python fast_rgb_box.py
